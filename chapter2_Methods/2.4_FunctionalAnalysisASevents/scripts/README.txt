The main notebooks and wrappers in this folder are order for readibility by the first two numbers in the name of the file. Script files without a number at the beginning are executed by a wrapper or loaded in a notebook. To understand all codes, follow the the wrappers. In this case, the final two steps are independent from each other and can be executed separately. The last notebook 03_GEDI_pathways is included for demonstration purposes only. It cannot be reproduced since the data is part of an ongoing project and is not publicly available.
